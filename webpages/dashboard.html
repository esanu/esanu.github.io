                    </b> <br />
                    Data architecture design for flexible and scalable solution that provides real-time insights into
                    critical system's performance at major US pharmaceutical chain.

                    <b>Project Goals: </b> Our primary goal was to design an IT architecture that
                    will allow executives in the office of the CIO of a $136 billion pharmaceutical chain 
                    to monitor and report on the health and performance indicators of critical retail systems (e.g. POS, Supply Chain systems)
                    across the United States in real-time. </br>
                    A sample of indicators to be monitored include:<br />
                    (i) Receipt Print Time <br />
                    (ii) Payment Authorization Time<br />
                    (iii) Item Scan Time <br />

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <b>Design Approach: </b> The architecture design was broken up into 4 logical phases from the source data to final output.

                    For this project, the visualization phase was out of scope. We researched and identified potential solutions that met client requirements for all in-scope phases (ingestion, storage and transformation). The architectural design options were evaluated using a scorecard for a final recommendation before tools and vendors were selected.
