                The data provided is for an on-demand delivery company, Delivex, providing a platform connecting delivery-partners and customers purchasing a variety of goods.

                The platform sends delivery-partners to merchants to purchase and
                pickup any items requested by the customer. Whenever possible, Delivex will order the
                requested items ahead to save the delivery-partners time. Each time a Delivex delivery is
                completed, a record is saved to the Delivex database that contains information about that
                delivery. Delivex is growing fast and has just launched in its newest market -- New York
                City. <br>

            <p class="bodytext">

                
                The analysis is for the CEO of Delivex wants to know how things are going in New York. ....He has
                mentioned to you that he’s heard reports of data integrity issues.<br><br>

                
                <b>Analysis</b><br>
                Delivex's business vision is to transform the way goods
                move around the city by having anything delivered on-demand. <br><br>

                For my analysis, I will explore 3 key areas:<br>
                <b>Revenue & Growth:</b> How is the health of the business? Is Delivex customer base growing? Are more deliveries being made in the city? Can Delivex sustain its operations in New York City? <br>
                <b>Operations:</b> How quickly are deliveries being made? How precisely are deliveries being made? <br>
                <b>Technology:</b> How easy is it to place orders on the platform? <br><br>

                In the month of October, there were 5214 deliveries from 3192 merchants made by 578 delivery-partners to 3192 customers.
                The top 10 merchants completed only 3% of deliveries. This indicates that Delivex is fufiling a part of it's business vision to have "anything" delivered on-demand. 29% of deliveries were completed by the top 10 delivery-partners, and top 10 customers made 12% of those orders. <br><br>

                *Data for time taken to complete the order is missing for about 50% of deliveries. Analysis is on 2500+ deliveries, which is a significant sample. <br><br>


                Some data quality and integrity issues were identified during analysis. <br>

                • 32 duplicate records found in data provided <br>
                • There is no primary key (unique) to identify records. When multiple items are ordered in a single delivery, the delivery data is recorded for each item using the same delivery ID. <br>
                • Up to 50% records have some missing values. From initial analysis, some data is missing by design. For example, when the order requests for inventory on hand, data for 'when_the_dpartner_arrived_at_pickup' and 'when_the_dpartner_left_pickup' is unavailable. The missing data may also skew analysis. <br>
                • There are some data inconsistencies in file provided For example, data recorded for item categories include, “A la Cart” and “A la Carte”, “Appetizer” and “Appetizers”

                <b>Revenue & Growth:</b><br>
                • Cluster & cohort analysis to better understand customers and behavior <br>
                • Model customer behavior/journey to understand customer funnel, churn & retention <br>
                • Integrate on-demand delivery data with external data sources  e.g. NY demographic data, real estate prices, and so on, to gain for further insights <br><br>

                <b>Operations:</b><br>
                • Provide incentives for delivery-partners delivering with optimal vehicle type. (Statistically significant efficiencies from the cost of delivery, time to deliver, etc.). Incentives could be financial (e.g bonuses) or non-financial (e.g. badges, or points earned on delivery leaderboard) <br> 
                • Further analysis into customer on-demand ordering behaviour. For example, why are there more deliveries on Sunday? <br>
                • Cleanse data and conduct analysis on favorite places and frequently order items. Delivery partners can stock up on these items or Delivex can enter into partnerships with customer's favorite places. <br><br>

                <b>Technology:</b><br>
                • Discuss with product & engineering teams about application and database design to understand trade off between user friction and collecting data. <br>
                • Work with operations to standardize the process for collecting data and ensuring data quality. For example, new process could ensure that the delivery partners are entering their receipts to reduce missing values and data inconsistencies <br>
                • Validate data format and database constraints
