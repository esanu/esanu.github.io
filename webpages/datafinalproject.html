                I made these sketches to go along with my story arc. <br>
                Initially, I intend to start off discussing the beginnings of the internet, the growth in usage and the number of pages pages. This growth can be shown with a chart similar to Figure 1 (as labeled in my sketches). Data used should show exponential growth in these metrics. I sketched line and bar charts in one figure to show these trends over time but for the final deliverable, I may separate out these figures.<br><br>

                Next, my story will go into all the benefits (e.g. connection, increased access to information, innovation and so on) of the internet and how we are spending a lot more time on the internet (chart shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2). Next I'll go into how trends in internet usage has changed over time (Figure 3). Figure 7 is another option to show the trends in internet usage. This leads me to the cons of the internet. No charts have been planned for this section at this time.  <br><br>

                Figure 4 shows a huge dollar amount to trigger a reaction from the reaction. This is the valley of the story, when users realize how much their time and attention is monetized. Figure 5 shows how much of internet traffic is attributed to big tech companies that profit enormously from keeping us on the internet. <br><br>

                My story goes on to the call to action. We need to be more aware of how we're spending our time and how our time on the internet affects internal stability, happiness. Figure 6 shows a negative correlation between amount of internet usage and health and wellness. Ideally, data should show a negative correlation between these metrics or some other indicator. Finally, I wrap up my story by discussing additional benefits to reducing internet usage. <br><br>
