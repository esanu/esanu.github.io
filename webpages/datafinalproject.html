                I made these sketches to go along with my story arc. <br>
                Initially, I intend to start off discussing the beginnings of the internet, the growth in usage and the number of pages pages. This growth can be shown with a chart similar to Figure 3.1 (as labeled in my sketches). Data used should show exponential growth in these metrics. I sketched line and bar charts in one figure to show these trends over time but for the final deliverable, I may separate out these figures.<br><br>

                Next, my story will go into all the benefits (e.g. connection, increased access to information, innovation and so on) of the internet and how we are spending a lot more time on the internet (chart shown in Figure 3.1 and Figure 3.2). Next I'll go into how trends in internet usage has changed over time (Figure 3.3). Figure 3.7 is another option to show the trends in internet usage. This leads me to the cons of the internet. No charts have been planned for this section at this time.  <br><br>

                Figure 3.4 shows a huge dollar amount to trigger a reaction from the reaction. This is the valley of the story, when users realize how much their time and attention is monetized. Figure 3.5 shows how much of internet traffic is attributed to big tech companies that profit enormously from keeping us on the internet. <br><br>

                My story goes on to the call to action. We need to be more aware of how we're spending our time and how our time on the internet affects internal stability, happiness. Figure 6 shows a negative correlation between amount of internet usage and health and wellness. Ideally, data should show a negative correlation between these metrics or some other indicator. Finally, I wrap up my story by discussing additional benefits to reducing internet usage. <br><br>
                
                <b>Data:</b><br>  
                For this project, I intend to use publicly available data and statistics on internet history, usage, search trends and personal data on internet usage. <br>
                (1) My google chrome browsing history on my laptop and mobile phone. I thought it'd be interesting to use my data to see how I'm spending my time on the internet and see how it compares to reported statistics for the average user. I intend to categorize browsing history to make data usable.<br>
                (2)Mobile apps and usage metrics (if available) on my mobile phone. I intend to get the same value out of this data as (1) above.<br>
                (3) Google search trends found <a hrep="https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US">here</a>. I can use this data to identify trends in Google searches to see how people are using the internet and see how searches are changing over time.<br>
                (4) Internet World Statistics found <a href="https://www.internetworldstats.com/emarketing.htm">here</a>
                (5) Digital Trends 2019 found <a href="https://thenextweb.com/contributors/2019/01/30/digital-trends-2019-every-single-stat-you-need-to-know-about-the-internet/">here</a>
                (6) Relationship between internet use and depression/sickness/dumbness/ignorance found found <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/feb/03/excessive-internet-use-depression">here</a>
                
                <br><br>
         
                <b>Presentation method and medium: </b><br>
                For the final deliverable, I will use Shorthand to present findings from my analysis. For the final presentation, I will consider my findings and build visuals around 1-2 impactful insights.

                    <b>Part II:</b> Wireframes and user research. Submitted: Wednesday, July 31, 2019 <br>

                <b>User Research Protocol</b><br>
                <b>Target Audience: </b>The target audience for this project is for heavy internet users. How would do I define heavy? They have at least 2 social media accounts, communicate primarily over the internet and not mobile networks and spend at least 20 hours a week on an internet connected device. <br>
                Students are a great group that meet this requirement. To keep survey sample heterogenous, I will talk to internet users from different generations because the internet has shaped these different generations in different ways.<br> <br>
                <b>Representative Individuals: </b>Because of the penetration of the internet and the subject of the project, <br><br>
                <b>Interview Script: </b> Hey, I'm working on this project for a data that tries to understand more about how people are using the internet. I'm working on the outline of the final part now. Could you give me some feedback to make sure my story makes sense?<br> <br>
                
                The story may start off with how prevalent the internet is. In my final deliverable, I intend to use the trend graph that shows the exponential growth in internet users to also illustrate the history of the internet, using line markers to signify major moments in history. <br>

                Next, I want to highlight the great benefits of the internet and going to show how much time people spend on the internet, which I hope would be shocking to audience. Somehow, I want to tie this into how valuable our time and attention is. So valuable that companies are spending millions to get us to use their product more and making billions in returns when we do. <br><br> And what do we get? Nothing. <br><br>
                
                That's  why I'm asking people to be more deliberate about how they use the internet. Who they give their data to, how much time they spend surfing, and to question everything.<br><br> 
                <b>Questions</b> <br>
                1. What was most useful about this? <br>
                2. Does it inspire you to change your behavior? <br>

                <b>Interview Findings: </b><br>

                <b>Changes made from interviews: </b><br>
                1. Internet usage may be varied across generations, so to make a more impactful point, I will show data for a specific group of internet users e.g. children between the ages of 10 and 15 years or millenials because they are more likely to be heavy internet users; the target audience for this message. Also, for the final presentation a majority of the audience will likely be from the millenial generation.
